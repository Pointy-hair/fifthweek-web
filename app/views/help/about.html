        <h4>About Fifthweek</h4>
        <p>
          Fifthweek is a platform for premium blogs: it's the simplest possible way to make a blog and share it with
          paying subscribers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wanted to create somewhere that lifts all the inhibitions around paying for content - because when you pay,
          you receive so much more value than you put in. Everyone should get the opportunity to experience great independent
          publications, lovingly crafted blogs and inside secrets from their favourite industry experts. However, no-one
          enjoys cycling through bookmarks or having to manage 5 different subscriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are bringing the discoverability and convenience of the free web to premium content.
          We are reducing sign-up friction to a single click. We are unifying all of a user's subscriptions into a single
          feed and making new and relevant subscriptions easy to find. There's no adverts, just great content in its purest form.
