        <h4>About Fifthweek</h4>
        <p>
          Fifthweek is somewhere to share content worth paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the simplest possible way for a creator to setup a blog and exclusively share new content with paying subscribers.
          Viewers get to experience more of their favourite content, untouched by adverts and conveniently delivered, while creators
          spend more time working on their best creations.
        </p>
        <p>Founders James Thurley and Lawrence Wagerfield began Fifthweek in September 2014. The company is based in the UK.</p>
