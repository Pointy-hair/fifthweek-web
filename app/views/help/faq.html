        <h4>What is Fifthweek?</h4>
        <p>Somewhere to share content worth paying for - it's a premium blogging platform.</p>
        <p>Turns out that when people perceive any amount of value in something, they're usually happy to pay a small amount to receive it. All those great comics, video blogs and journalistic niches. We'll help to bring more of those to life. Not by donations or crowd-funding. Just simple micro-payments, motivated purely by awesome content.</p>

        <h4>I'm a creator living in the EU, will VAT MOSS affect me?</h4>
        <p class="first">No, you will be transacting with us in a business-to-business relationship. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Prices are advertised to subscribers as GROSS. This means everyone sees the same price, and every subscriber pays the same amount.</li>
          <li>We will pay the correct VAT for that subscriber, meaning what's left over will change from country-to-country. This is the 'NET' amount.</li>
          <li>We will take our 20&#37; fee from the NET amount, and pay you the remaining 80&#37; as a supplier.</li>
          <li>If you are VAT registered, we will pay you VAT ontop of that 80&#37;.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>An example...</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>You create a blog and set a GROSS price of &#36;1.25.</li>
          <li>James from Sweden, like everyone else in the world, will pay &#36;1.25 for your blog.</li>
          <li>We will pay the correct Swedish VAT of 25&#37; out of that &#36;1.25 - i.e. VAT MOSS is handled our side.</li>
          <li>&#36;1.00 is left after paying VAT.</li>
          <li>We take &#36;0.20 and will pay you &#36;0.80</li>
          <li>&#42;If you are VAT registered&#42;, and let's assume in the UK, we will pay you 20&#37; ontop. That's &#36;0.96.</li>
        </ol>
