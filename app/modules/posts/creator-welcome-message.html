<h4>Welcome to Fifthweek!</h4>
<p>
  This page will display your live posts once you have created some content.
</p>
<p>
  First we suggest you view your public profile by selecting "View Profile" from the menu,
  and then customize it to encourage people to subscribe.
</p>
<p>
  Or whenever you are ready you can start adding posts using the "New Post" menu item. Live posts
  will appear here, and you can view any posts scheduled for a future date in the "Scheduled Posts" area.
</p>
<p>
  Finally you can start sharing your profile and bringing people on board.
  The link to your profile is shown on the Edit Profile page.
  Remember, people are only billed for weeks in which you post content.
