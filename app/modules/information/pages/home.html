          <h2>Removing the barriers to participation.</h2>
          <p>
            Everything published to a Fifthweek channel is ephemeral; it lasts only 30 days. This encourages participation
            by removing the permanent record, and focuses discussion on what you're doing now. It lets you price your
            channel lower, bringing more people on board.

            Forget about tiers and milestones, rewards and pledges.
            On Fifthweek you simply create a channel, set a weekly price, publish content, and let people subscribe.
            We believe a simpler platform means more subscribers, which means more funding for your work.

            We're not the only funding platform in town! Here are some great alternatives:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a></strong> is the original
            crowdfunding website. Aimed more at one-off funding campaigns, they set the standard for everyone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="http://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank">Patreon</a></strong> specializes in recurring funding.
            They are structured similar to Kickstarter, with multiple tiers (we have multiple channels, which is similar),
            and milestone goals. They only take 5% commission, but pass payment processing fees on to the creator, which can become
            expensive if you're expecting smaller pledges.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="http://www.tapastic.com/" target="_blank">Tapastic</a></strong> is a recurring funding platform
            aimed at the comic industry. It has lots of comic specific features, and is focused more on consuming the final product
            than nurturing ideas and getting feedback. They take a flat 50% (absorbing fees), and also have an ad revenue sharing program.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="http://www.pubslush.com/" target="_blank">Pubslush</a></strong> is a crowdfunding platform aimed directly
            at authors and publishers, and one-off funding campaigns.
          </p>
          <p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a></strong> is similar to Kickstarter,
            but larger due to a more relaxed entry criteria. They are also aimed at one-off funding campaigns.
