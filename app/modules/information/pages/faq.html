          <h2>I'm a creator living in the EU, will VAT MOSS affect me?</h2>
          <p class="first">Nope! You leave that to us.</p>
          <p>
            You will be transacting with us in a business-to-business
            relationship, as a supplier to Fifthweek. That means we will be collecting payments from subscribers (and therefore handling VATMOSS), which means we can
            simply pay you as a supplier. Suppliers in business-to-business trade do not get hit with VATMOSS.
          </p>
          <h3>How the payment process works</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Prices are advertised to subscribers as GROSS. This means everyone sees the same price, and every subscriber pays the same amount.</li>
            <li>We will pay the correct VAT for that subscriber, meaning what's left over will change from country-to-country. This is the NET amount.</li>
            <li>We will take our 20&#37; fee from the NET amount, and pay you the remaining 80&#37; as a supplier.</li>
            <li>If you are VAT registered, we will pay you VAT ontop of that 80&#37;.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>An example with a Swedish subscriber for a UK creator</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>You create a blog and set a GROSS price of &#36;1.25.</li>
            <li>James from Sweden, like everyone else in the world, will pay &#36;1.25 for your blog.</li>
            <li>We will pay the correct Swedish VAT of 25&#37; out of that &#36;1.25.</li>
            <li>&#36;1.00 is left after paying VAT.</li>
            <li>We take &#36;0.20 and will pay you &#36;0.80</li>
            <li>&#42;If you are VAT registered&#42;, and let's assume in the UK, we will pay you 20&#37; ontop. That's &#36;0.96.</li>
          </ol>
