        <h2>Are there any setup fees?</h2>
        <p>
          Nope. No setup fees or hidden costs. It's free to create a Fifthweek blog. It's also free to share your blog with others. We only take payment when you do.

        <h2>What about transaction fees?</h2>
        <p>
          We pay all transaction costs. There are no additional charges beyond the 30% we receive. This
          benefits creators with a predictable and assured revenue from each transaction, compared to pricing models with
          fixed costs which often consume profits on smaller transactions.

        <h2>What about VATMOSS?</h2>
        <p>
          Fifthweek is VATMOSS compliant. We take care of everything on behalf of creators. The cost of VAT will be carried by EU subscribers, so the amount
          you receive as a creator stays unaffected.

        <h2>Who owns the content?</h2>
        <p>
          Creators own their content. Fifthweek does not claim any ownership rights to creators’ content. We are not a publisher, but a self-publishing platform.
