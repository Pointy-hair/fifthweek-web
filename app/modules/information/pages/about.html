        <h2>How it all started</h2>
        <p>
          The reason we looked to build Fifthweek was out of our own need. Not as content creators, but as everyday Internet users.
          We wondered, in a world where great content is typically given away for free, how much more of the best stuff
          would be possible if we, as willing consumers, could pay a handful of pennies to receive it.

        <h2>We wanted more great content</h2>
        <p>
          We wanted somewhere to go when we wanted more from our favourite creators. Like how you reach for your Kindle
          for a new eBook, or the AppStore for some software. What if there were something like that, but for online content,
          that similarly made paying for it almost forgettable, and just gave you instant access to more of your favourite things.
          Something that was discoverable, like Instagram or Pinterest, but filled entirely with content worth paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          We thought that would be pretty awesome.

        <h2>So we built Fifthweek</h2>
        <p>
          It's just a start, but by designing a new platform around sharing and receiving paid content, we're helping
          to make more of the Internet's greatest parts come to life. We'll always love the free stuff, but we're
          even more excited to see what comes next, now that our favourite creators are really able to offer more.
