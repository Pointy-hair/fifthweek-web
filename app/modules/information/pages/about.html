        <p>
          The reason we looked to build Fifthweek was out of our own need. Not as content creators, but as everyday Internet users.
          We wondered, in a world where great content is typically given away for free, how much more of the best stuff
          would be possible if we, as hungry consumers, could pay a handful of pennies to receive it.

          It's just a start, but by providing a better way to share and receive paid content, we're helping to make more of the
          Internet's greatest inspirations come to life. We'll always love the free stuff, but we're even more excited
          to see what our favourite creators are really capable of.
