          <h2>How it all started</h2>
          <p>
            The reason we looked to build Fifthweek was out of our own need. Not as content creators, but as everyday Internet users.
            We wondered, in a world where great content is typically given away for free, how much more of the best stuff
            would be possible if we could pay to receive it. (We're just talking a handful of pennies.)

          <h2>We wanted more great content</h2>
          <p>
            We wanted somewhere to get more from our favourite creators. Like how you reach for your Kindle
            for a new eBook, or the AppStore for some software. We wanted something like that, but for online content,
            that similarly made paying for it almost forgettable, and just gave you instant access to more of your favourite things.

          <h2>So we built Fifthweek</h2>
          <p>
            It's just a start, but by designing a new platform around premium content, we're helping
            to make more of the Internet's greatest parts come to life.
            We'll always love the free stuff, but we're
            even more excited to see what comes next, now that our favourite creators are really able to offer more.
