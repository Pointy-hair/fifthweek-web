            You can get started by browsing the latest posts on our home page (we will have more
            discoverability features coming soon). If you already know of a creator on Fifthweek,
            you can go directly to their landing page to see what they are offering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have found a creator to which you would like to subscribe, simply click on the Subscribe button
            on either their landing page or one of their posts.

          </p>
          <p>
            You'll be taken through a few simple steps to create your first channel, after which you can start publishing
            your content right away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially your channel is only visible to those who you share it with. However once you are happy with
            the quality of your offering, <a ui-sref="contact">contact us</a> and we will make it discoverable on
            the site once it has passed our own quality checks.
