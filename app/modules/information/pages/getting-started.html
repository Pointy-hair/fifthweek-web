          <h3>What is Fifthweek?</h3>
          <p>
            Fifthweek is a funding platform for creative people.
          </p>
          <p>
          You can create a channel, set a weekly price, and start posting content to that channel.
            If people like what they see, they can pay the subscription to get full access.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also create additional channels, and people can subscribe to those as well.
          </p>
          <h3>How do I become a creator?</h3>
          <p>
            Simply register as normal then click on "Publish" in the sidebar.  As soon as you have created some
            content you can share your channel and people can start subscribing.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also <a ui-sref="contact">contact us</a> and
            we will make your content discoverable on Fifthweek once it has passed our own quality checks.
          </p>
          <h3>Can people see what I post without subscribing?</h3>
          <p>
            People need to see what they're going to get in order to decide if they want to subscribe.
            Therefore we automatically show previews of all the content that you post.
          </p>
          <p>
            For photos, we show a faded, watermarked version. For articles, we show the introduction with the rest of the article redacted.
          </p>
          <h3>Can people share what I post?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely, we want people to share your posts on social media to spread the word.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Therefore every user gets two free Fifthweek posts every week</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When your post gets shared, anyone can use one of their free posts to view it immediately.
            Your paid content can still go viral.
          </p>
          <h3>Can I give some people free access?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! By adding people onto your Guest List you can give them free access to all your channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could add friends, family, Patreon supporters or anyone else you fancy.

            You can get started by browsing the latest posts on our home page (we will have more
            discoverability features coming soon). If you already know of a creator on Fifthweek,
            you can go directly to their landing page to see what they are offering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have found a creator to which you would like to subscribe, simply click on the Subscribe button
            on either their landing page or one of their posts.

            If you have already signed in and have credit on your account, then you can immediately start enjoying
            your new content.

          <p>
            Otherwise you can follow the instructions to create an account and provide your payment information, after
            which the new content will be immediately available.
