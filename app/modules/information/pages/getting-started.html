          Firstly create your blog on Fifthweek. We keep all blogs under one roof so we can provide cool features like
          one-click payments and discoverability. You can customize your blog and provide more information about what
          you'll be sharing. You can even include a video (which we highly recommend!).

        <h2><span class="heading-number">2)</span> Upload photos, videos, articles...</h2>
        <p>
          Share anything you like. Fifthweek allows creators to post content in many different formats, and preserves
          the original quality of everything you upload - that means no harsh compression or resizing.
          If you want to schedule your posts over several weeks, you
          can do that too. You can even share different content with different levels of subscribers, allowing you to offer
          something for everyone.

          It's the moment your followers have been waiting for: a way to enjoy more from their favourite creator! (That's you.)

          <strong>Fifthweek is a centralised platform</strong> like Tumblr and Instagram, except everything here is worth paying for.
          Creators set a small subscription price for their content, and in a single click you can access it for immediate
          enjoyment.
